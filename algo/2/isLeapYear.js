/*
Write a function which can determine whether a year is a leap year. It must return `true` if it is, and `false` otherwise.
Reminder: A leap year checks **one** of these rules:
- It's divisible by 4, without being divisible by 100
- It's divisible by 400
Ex: 2004, 2016 and 2020 are leap years
Note bene: To check whether a number is divisible by another, you should use the "modulo" operator (%)
*/

function isLeapYear(year) {
  return year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !==0 || year % 400 === 0; 
}

module.exports = isLeapYear;
